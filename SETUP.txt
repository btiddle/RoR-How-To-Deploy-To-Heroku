Task:     RoR How To Deploy To Heroku
=====================================================

===============
Introduction
===============
Heroku: Platform as a service!

That means Heroku is a piece of software that we can use that ultimately
ends up hosting ours apps on their hardware; it is a complete package.

Much easier to configure than a real cloud server.

Scales nicely, but not one-size-fits-all.

Heroku is great for frameworks because it can auto detect them!
